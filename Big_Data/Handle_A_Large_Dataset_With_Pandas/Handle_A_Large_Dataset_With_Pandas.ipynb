      "1,\"Installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs).Some championship races and cars can only be \"\"unlocked\"\" by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.I'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally, and you should to. :)http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341886844&sr;=8-1&keywords;=richard+burns+rallyThank you for reading my review!

Music it is very European and even the voices from the game very &#34;English&#34; accent.The multiplayer isn't the best but it works just ok.\n",
